Hello! I'm Peter Ahrens, a computer scientist and glassblower at MIT. As a graduate student advised by [Saman Amarasinghe](https://people.csail.mit.edu/saman/), I use algorithms to find patterns in data that enable us to process it more efficiently. I'm on the hunt for algorithms that can effectively map irregular computations, such as contractions over sparse matrices and tensors, to limited computing resources, such as registers, caches, and parallel processors. I get excited about techniques like graph partitioning, code generation, sketching and sampling. My work is listed on my [publications](https://peterahrens.io/publications/) page. I'm incredibly grateful to be supported by a Department of Energy Computational Science Graduate Fellowship.

Glassblowing adds balance to my life. I blow glass and teach first-time glassblowers at the MIT Glass Lab. If you're curious, I've highlighted some of my favorite creations in my [portfolio](https://peterahrens.io/portfolio/).
