As a computer science graduate student advised by [Saman Amarasinghe](https://people.csail.mit.edu/saman/), I write algorithms to map irregular computations, such as contractions over sparse matrices and tensors, to limited computing resources, such as registers, caches, and parallel processors. I'm excited about techniques like graph partitioning, code generation, sketching, and sampling, and I strive to bridge the gap between heuristic approaches and theoretical guarantees. My work is listed on my [publications](/publications/) page. I'm incredibly grateful to be supported by a Department of Energy Computational Science Graduate Fellowship.

Glassblowing adds balance to my life. I blow glass and teach first-time glassblowers at the MIT Glass Lab. If you're curious, I've highlighted some of my favorite creations in my [portfolio](/portfolio/).
